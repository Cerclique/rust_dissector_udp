# rust_dissector_udp

This sample is used to test dissector generated by [rust_dissector_generator](https://github.com/Cerclique/rust_dissector_generator) by sending a custom `Data` structure over UDP.

### Note

By default, the structure defined in the sample correspond to [dissector example](https://github.com/Cerclique/wirdigen/blob/master/data/example_dissector.json) shipped with [Wirdigen](https://crates.io/crates/wirdigen) library.

Most of the structure is filled with random value since the main point is to correctly check that the packet is well-dissected into Wireshark.
